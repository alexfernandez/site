Mediasmart is a demand side platform born for mobile that tracks post-click events both in the web and the in-app environment and that programmatically buys media in real time using a) predictive targeting to maximize campaign engagement and b) sophisticated campaign segmentation to reach specific audiences. All of mediasmart´s power is available through an intuitive web app and an extensive API.

## Advanced Targeting Options

When it comes to segmentation and targeting, the mobile nature of mediasmart makes the difference. You can segment your campaigns using a lot of mobile specific variables without having to sacrifice reach. These are some examples of possible segmentation variables:

 - Mobile operator
 - Device type
 - Device make and model
 - Language
 - Connection type: Wifi vs Cellular
 - Operation system and version
 - App vs Mobile Web
 - Publisher by name, site ID or app ID/bundle ID
 - User Interests based on prior behaviour from more than 300 million users
 - Demographic information: Age and Gender
 - Geolocation: country, region, city and zipcode
 - Geofencing with multiple levels of precision
 - IP address
 - User ID: IDFA or GAID
 - Type of user ID: cookie, IDFA, GAID

You can also run retargeting campaigns or target dynamic audiences. Create your own audiences and enrich them with every new campaign you run, either using mediasmart only or easily integrating with your very own DMP.
