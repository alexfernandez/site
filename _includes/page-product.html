      <h2>Advanced Targeting Options</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to segmentation and targeting, the mobile nature of mediasmart makes the difference. You can segment your campaigns using a lot of mobile specific variables without having to sacrifice reach. These are some examples of possible segmentation variables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile operator</li>
        <li>Device type</li>
        <li>Device make and model</li>
        <li>Language</li>
        <li>Connection type: Wifi vs Cellular</li>
        <li>Operation system and version</li>
        <li>App vs Mobile Web</li>
        <li>Publisher by name, site ID or app ID/bundle ID</li>
        <li>User Interests based on prior behaviour from more than 300 million users</li>
        <li>Demographic information: Age and Gender</li>
        <li>Geolocation: country, region, city and zipcode</li>
        <li>Geofencing with multiple levels of precision</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>User ID: IDFA or GAID</li>
        <li>Type of user ID: cookie, IDFA, GAID</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also run retargeting campaigns or target dynamic audiences. Create your own audiences and enrich them with every new campaign you run, either using mediasmart only or easily integrating with your very own DMP.
